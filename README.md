# Hello, there! ✨
<sup>The name is Marina, but you can call me Mary if you prefer! 😎</sup> <br />

I'm a developer from Brazil living in Canada since 2020! 🇧🇷🇨🇦 <br />
I lived for 2 years in Quebec, _la belle province_, but now I call the beautiful British Columbia home ❤️ <br /><br />


### My work experience at a glance ⚡
I've been working as a developer since 2015, having started with PL/SQL and Java at IBM, but 
I changed to Web Development in 2017 and never looked back 👀 <br />

The first 3 years in the Web Development area were mainly working with the MEAN stack, with a touch of mobile development and 
a few different tools and libraries. I was a Fullstack Developer in an agency in Brazil and there I had the chance to work in **many** different 
projects, from kiosks to websites, mobile apps and games. <br />
<sup>Keywords: Angular, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Ionic, Websockets, Android, game development </sup>


After moving to Canada, I had a brief period of my career where I worked together with the HR helping recruiters to find the best developers 
for their roles. It was great having the chance to talk with many different people from around the world! ...but really, I missed working 
as a developer. Like, **a lot**, so back to development I went! 🥳 <br />
This time I worked with React, which was something I've never worked before. I worked as a FE developer giving maintanance and creating new pages and 
tools for a recruiting platform - yes, the same as before! There, I had the chance to learn more about React and its environment, and now I
totally see what's all the hype about 😆 <br />
